Please find the attached sheet, which includes remarks regarding the workitems.

Most of the workitems are encountering SMTP errors.

There are two workitems for which we are not triggering emails; we are sending only SMS notifications for these.

The rest of the workitems are successfully triggering emails to test1@rakbanktst.ae
.

For the TS workitem, emails are sent to testuser10@rakbanktst.ae
.

Could you please check the mailbox logs for testuser10@rakbanktst.ae
 to help investigate the issue?

Let me know if you need any further information.
