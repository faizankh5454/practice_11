Hi @Bhushan Sanjay,

As we can see, all the worktime numbers are from the month of September. However, from our side, the Infobip SMTP server pointing was done starting from October 1st. That is why you are not able to see the logs before this date.

Additionally, if there are any work items from September, they were successfully triggered from our side. If you are not receiving the logs for those, please connect with @Shaiju M for further verification.

Thank you.
